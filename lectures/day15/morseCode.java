// create a class called morse code which takes in a string and two methods to encode and decode. create a driver class called test morse code which creates an arrayList of morse code and facilitates implementation of encode and decode 

class morseCode{
    String sent; 
    char code;

    morseCode(String sent, char code){
        this.sent = sent; 
        this.code = code;
