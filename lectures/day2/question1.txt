3. What is OLAP?

OLAP stands for On-Line Analytical Processing. OLAP is a classification of software technology which authorizes analysts, managers, and executives to gain insight into information through fast, consistent, interactive access in a wide variety of possible views of data that has been transformed from raw information to reflect the real dimensionality of the enterprise as understood by the clients.

OLAP implement the multidimensional analysis of business information and support the capability for complex estimations, trend analysis, and sophisticated data modeling.


4. How OLAP Works?

Fundamentally, OLAP has a very simple concept. It pre-calculates most of the queries that are typically very hard to execute over tabular databases, namely aggregation, joining, and grouping. These queries are calculated during a process that is usually called 'building' or 'processing' of the OLAP cube. This process happens overnight, and by the time end users get to work - data will have been updated.
